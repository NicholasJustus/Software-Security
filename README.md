# Software-Security
Portfolio work for CS-305 Software Security at SNHU

## Reflection

**Client Summary:**  
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that required secure communication and protection of sensitive customer data. They asked me to address software vulnerabilities and implement secure coding practices.

**What I Did Well:**  
I successfully identified software vulnerabilities using dependency-check tools and refactored the code to reduce risks. Secure coding is essential because it protects customer trust and prevents financial or reputational damage.

**Challenges & Helpful Aspects:**  
The most challenging part was interpreting dependency-check results, but it taught me how to evaluate vulnerabilities by severity.

**Layers of Security:**  
I added checksum verification, SSL/TLS secure communication, and refactored unsafe code. In the future, I’d use static analysis tools and penetration testing.

**Ensuring Secure & Functional Code:**  
After refactoring, I tested the application to ensure output remained correct while vulnerabilities were reduced. I verified checksum functionality and HTTPS access.

**Resources Used:**  
Tools included Maven Dependency-Check, Eclipse, and Java’s security libraries. These will also be useful in future software security projects.

**What to Show Employers:**  
I would showcase my refactored code and report because they demonstrate my ability to identify vulnerabilities, apply secure coding practices, and deliver a functional secure application.
